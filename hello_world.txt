staging example sidney600.
create repo directory in home (cd ~) with mkdir
create new repo on github called git_test
check the add readme option
clone this repo to your computer with git clone SSHcopiedthing
now we have this repo locally
touch .txt to put a file in this repo
in repo, check status of files with git status
git status shows red for unstaged files, green for staged
stage the file with git add (file turns green in status, it is staged)
git commit -m 
after commit, status says "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

git log shows files added(staged), etc......
